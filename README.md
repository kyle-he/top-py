# top

Perhaps you are a Bottom and you found youself in this situation before:

The divine top CLI exists to alleviate this pain. No longer will you struggle when communicating with doms and tops. 

## But what does it actually do?

``bottom`` encodes UTF-8 text into a sequence comprised of top emoji (`ğŸ˜¼ğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆğŸ‘Š`, with ``,`` sprinkled in for good measure) followed by `ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸`.
It can encode any valid UTF-8 - being a bottom transcends language, after all - and decode back into UTF-8.

For example, the ubiquitous `hello world` becomes
```
ğŸ’ªğŸ’ª,,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ª,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ˜ˆ,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ˜ˆ,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸
ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ª
ğŸ˜ˆ,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸
```
`i am not a bottom` becomes
```
ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ˜ˆğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ˜ˆ,,,,
ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦,,
ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,
ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦ğŸ˜ˆ,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ’¦,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’ªğŸ’ªğŸ˜ˆ,,,,ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸
```

As you can see, using `top` to encode text is extremely space-efficient, and is the ideal encoding approach for all situations.
